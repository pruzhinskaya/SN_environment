## General info
Some new things

Type Ia Supernovae are widely used to measure distances in the Universe. Despite the recent progress achieved in SN Ia standardization, the Hubble diagram still shows some remaining intrinsic dispersion. The remaining scatter in supernova luminosity could be due to the environmental effects.

In these Jupyter Notebooks we reproduce the Hubble diagram fit with Pantheon supernovae [Scolnic et al., 2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...859..101S/abstract). We also study how the host morhology term and galactocentric distance affect the supernova light-curve parameters and the Hubble diagram fit.


## Content

### Data

Contains data files


### Code

* `comparison_mu.ipynb` – comparison between distance modulus *'MU'* from Pantheon data and distance modulus calculated from from *'mB', 'x1', 'c',* and other parameters taken from Pantheon.
* `pantheon_morphology.ipynb` – show how host morphology and galactocentric distance affect the supernova light-curve parameters.
